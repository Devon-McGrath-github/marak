# Welcome to our final project!

* Clone the repo down
* Create your branch
* npm install
* Currently using `node server/server.js` to test-run server

# Things to consider

* Use the knex scripts to generate migrations and seeds
* Double check scripts in package.json (especially server/lib/)
* Create Procfile for use with heroku (not sure if you have to)
* Copy eslint.json file from previous project if team agrees
* Agree on which test framework to use

# Important: Double check scripts in package.json and gitignore: amend or add when necessary
